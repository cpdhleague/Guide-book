# =============================================================
# video-to-post.yml - Convert GitHub Issues into Jekyll blog posts
# =============================================================
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. A user opens a GitHub Issue with a title like "YouTube: Cool PDH Video"
# 2. The issue body contains a link (line 1) and optional notes
# 3. This workflow runs a Python script that:
#    - Extracts the video/podcast link
#    - Optionally runs AI to expand short notes into a full article
#    - Downloads thumbnails (YouTube)
#    - Generates a Jekyll markdown post
# 4. A Pull Request is created for admin review before publishing
#
# SUPPORTED TITLE PREFIXES:
#   YouTube:  → Embeds a YouTube video, downloads thumbnail
#   Spotify:  → Embeds a Spotify player (episode or show)
#   Article:  → Plain text article with optional link buttons
#
# LEARNING NOTE ON GITHUB ACTIONS:
# A "workflow" is an automated process that runs when something
# happens in your repo (like opening an issue). Each workflow has
# "jobs" made of "steps." Steps run sequentially — if one fails,
# the rest are skipped (unless you use `if: failure()`).

      # ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTE:
      # We pass issue data as ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, not shell arguments.
      #
      # THE OLD (BROKEN) WAY:
      #   run: python script.py "${{ github.event.issue.body }}"
      #
      # This is called "shell injection" — the issue body gets pasted
      # directly into a shell command. If someone submits a URL like:
      #   https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc&feature=shared
      # The shell sees the & as "run next command in background."
      # Worse, a malicious user could submit:
      #   "; rm -rf / #
      # ...and run arbitrary commands on your server.
      #
      # THE SAFE WAY (what we do now):
      # Pass data through `env:` — GitHub Actions sets these as proper
      # environment variables, which Python reads with os.environ.get().
      # No shell parsing, no injection, no breakage from special chars.

            This can happen if:
            - The first line of your issue doesn't contain a valid YouTube or Spotify link
            - The link format isn't recognized
            - There was a temporary API issue

            Please double-check your issue body, or check the [Actions tab](/${{ github.repository }}/actions) for details.
