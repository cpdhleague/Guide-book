**CPDH.guide** is the premier resource hub for the Competitive Pauper Commander (cPDH) community. Our mission is to provide clear, actionable metagame data, high-quality articles, and essential tools to help you build better decks, play smarter, and win more.

## What We Do

We collect and analyze tournament data from across the cPDH community to deliver accurate metagame breakdowns, commander ratings, player statistics, and historical trends. Combined with community-driven articles, deck techs, and video features, CPDH.guide is your one-stop shop for everything competitive PDH.

## Our History

The project began in May 2021 as the cPDH Decklist Database (DDB) — a community-sourced effort to build consensus around what constitutes a "competitive" Pauper Commander deck. What started as a Google Spreadsheet evolved into a full-fledged platform with dedicated metagame analysis, Elo-based commander ratings, a decklist library, and a growing content hub.

In January 2023, the project rebranded as **cPDH.guide** under its own dedicated infrastructure, with a functional team and community Discord server.

## The Team

CPDH.guide is maintained by a dedicated group of cPDH enthusiasts who volunteer their time to keep the data accurate, the content fresh, and the community thriving. If you'd like to get involved, reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UtgN272kpq) or [submit a guide](/articles/submit-guide/).
