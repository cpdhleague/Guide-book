  Submission Requirements: Deck Techs
</h2>

We welcome submissions for deck tech articles to be featured on **CPDH.guide**. Please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure a smooth review and publication process.

## Submission Requirements: The Deck Tech Template

To be published, your article must comprehensively address the following components in a clear and organized manner:

* **Gameplan Summary:** Provide a concise overview of the deck's primary win condition.
* **Gameplan Execution (Early, Mid, Late Game):** Detail the deck's operational path, describing how the core strategy unfolds across the early, middle, and late stages of a game.
* **Card Selection:**
    * Begin by outlining the broad categories of cards that support the main gameplan.
    * Follow with an in-depth analysis of each category. Explain their importance, provide relevant card examples, and elaborate on any complex or potentially unclear mechanics.
* **Interaction Strategy:** If the deck is designed to interact with opponents, clearly identify the types of opposing decks you are targeting and the specific answers included in your deck for those interactions.
* **Mana Base & Ramp:** Elaborate on the deck's mana base, which includes your land composition and any dedicated ramp package.
* **Package Variations:** Describe potential alternate card packages the deck could incorporate. Discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of these variations.
* **Card Considerations:**
    * **Testing:** List cards suitable for the deck that require further testing.
    * **Trap Cards:** Identify and explain cards that readers should specifically avoid playing in the deck, clarifying the reasoning.
* **Playing Against the Deck:** Conclude by informing readers who do not *intend* to play the deck on how to effectively counter it. This involves identifying key weaknesses and critical threats they should target.

## Important Clarification: PDH vs. cPDH

You must explicitly state in your email whether the submission is intended as a **PDH Guide** or a **cPDH Guide**.

> **cPDH Guides**
> These will undergo a higher level of content scrutiny. They must rigorously adhere to the structure above and focus on competitive viability.

> **PDH Guides**
> These allow for a more casual and fun tone. They do not require that all points above are strictly covered, provided they still offer a comprehensive view of the deck.

## The Submission Process

Once your deck tech article is complete, please submit the following via email to **[cpdhleague@gmail.com](mailto:cpdhleague@gmail.com)**.

**Please include:**
1.  **Subject Line:** "Deck Tech Submission"
2.  A **PDF** or **.docx** copy of your final article.
3.  A link to your full **decklist**.

We will then work with you to fine-tune the language, embed card images, and prepare your deck tech for online publication.

  Submission Requirements: Game Guides & Opinion Pieces
</h2>

We want your hot takes, your deep dives, and your masterclasses. While these formats are more free-form than our Deck Techs, we still ask that every piece be **exhaustive, well-informed, and polished.**

### Is it a Guide or an Opinion?
While there is often overlap, here is how we distinguish the two:

* **Game Guides:** These are **actionable**. Does your article literally teach the reader *how* to do something? Whether it's "How to Bluff Interaction" or "Constructing a Mana Base," if it offers concrete steps to improve gameplay, it's a Guide.
* **Opinion Pieces:** These are **interpretive**. Are you discussing the health of the format, the philosophy of kingmaking, or the future of a mechanic? If the topic is open to debate and less about "how-to," it's an Opinion.

*Note: Don't worry too much about the label—our curators will assign the final category based on the content.*
