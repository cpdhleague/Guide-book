excerpt: "Decked Out EDH throws down with an epic four-player battle in Pauper Commander!"
---

The Pauper Commander community just got a huge boost! We are absolutely thrilled that the fantastic crew over at Decked Out EDH has dropped a new video featuring the best budget format in Magic: The Gathering. Seeing such a high-profile Commander content creator dedicate a slot to PDH is validation for all the brewers, players, and advocates who champion the format.

If you haven’t clicked the link yet, stop reading and go watch! This video is not just highly entertaining—which is expected from the Decked Out EDH crew—but it serves as a wonderful introduction for thousands of players who might have only played traditional EDH. PDH offers a unique strategic challenge, forcing players to be creative and maximize value out of cards often overlooked in high-powered formats. Watching these creators grapple with the limitations and joys of a standardized common/uncommon rarity structure is pure, budget-friendly gold.

This kind of exposure is incredibly vital for the continued growth of Pauper Commander. Every time a major channel showcases the format, it encourages new people to sleeve up a deck for under $50 and join the fun. It confirms what we already knew: PDH provides all the political depth and social enjoyment of Commander, but with a much lower barrier to entry.

We encourage everyone in the PDH family to head over, watch the video, leave a positive comment showing our appreciation, and share it widely across your local playgroups and social media! Let’s show Decked Out EDH how vibrant and welcoming the Pauper Commander world is. A massive thanks to them for giving our beloved format the spotlight it deserves. Go watch, and maybe build a new budget brew tonight!
