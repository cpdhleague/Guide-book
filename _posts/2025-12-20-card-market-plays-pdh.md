## Card Market plays PDH!

We have some seriously exciting news for the Pauper Commander community! A major retailer and content powerhouse in the Magic world, Cardmarket, has thrown down their common cards and sat down for a game of PDH.

The video, simply titled “Card Market plays PDH!”, is a massive win for our format. Seeing one of the biggest names in European Magic coverage dedicate time and resources to showcasing the joy of Pauper Commander is the kind of organic exposure that helps our niche grow into the mainstream. It’s validation that what we already know—that PDH is strategic, accessible, and unbelievably fun—is catching the eye of the wider community.

For those unfamiliar, Cardmarket’s typical content focuses on high-level analysis and competitive formats. To see them pivot and showcase the budget-friendly, common-focused chaos that defines Pauper Commander is proof that the spirit of Magic transcends price tags. Whether they’re battling with powerful uncommons or janky commons, the energy and fun of the format shines through.

This video isn't just entertainment; it’s a recruiting tool. If you’ve been looking for a way to convince your EDH playgroup to try a more budget-conscious alternative, or if you simply want to show off what makes PDH unique, this video is the perfect resource.

Head over to the Cardmarket - Magic channel, give the video a watch, share it widely, and leave a comment showing them some love from the dedicated PDH community. The more engagement videos like this receive, the more likely we are to see more Pauper Commander content in the future. Let’s keep the momentum going!</blockquote>
