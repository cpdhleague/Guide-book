Jalapeno Paupers Draft Best PDH Removal

If there is one universal truth in Pauper Commander, it’s that interaction is king. You can have the most finely tuned synergy engine, but it all comes crashing down if you can’t answer a powerful opposing Uncommon Commander or a key common threat. That’s why the latest video from the wonderful crew at Jalapeno Paupers is absolutely essential viewing for PDH fans!

The Jalapenos are tackling one of the most fun and fiercely debated topics in the format: drafting the absolute best common removal spells. This isn't just a list; it’s a detailed discussion and ranking session designed to spark debate among veterans and provide crucial knowledge to new deck builders.

When you’re limited to commons for 99 of your cards, every slot matters. Should you prioritize the speed of a one-mana burn spell, the efficiency of an instant-speed counter, or the unconditional exile power of white removal? Every color offers compelling choices, and watching the team argue over whether Lightning Bolt truly dethrones Doom Blade is half the fun.

Whether you are looking for tips to refine your current 75% deck or struggling to find the perfect mix of answers for a new build, this video provides excellent insight into the critical decisions PDH players face. It’s a great showcase of community knowledge being shared in an accessible and entertaining way.

Head over and check out their latest video! See if your favorite pauper staple made the cut, and let us know in the comments: what common removal spell do you believe is the undisputed champion of Pauper Commander?
