The Pauper Commander community is buzzing whenever a new set drops, and nothing gets us more excited than seeing established creators jump right into the deep end! The excellent folks over at Jalapeno Paupers have just uploaded a must-watch video where they dive headfirst into the world of competitive PDH (cPDH), testing out some seriously spicy, brand-new Avatar Commanders.

If you’re looking for high-octane Pauper Commander action, this video delivers. The title alone confirms that they are experimenting with the recently printed Avatar creatures—cards that often introduce powerful, unique abilities to our format. Integrating these high-impact commanders into the optimized shell of cPDH requires precision brewing, and it’s a blast seeing which strategies the Jalapenos crew brought to the table.

It’s especially cool to see them using the guidelines established by the community-driven cPDH.guide. This focus on tuned, powerful interactions means the game is fast, decision-heavy, and full of explosive plays. Are the new Avatars truly competitive staples, or are they fun, fringe choices? You’ll have to tune in to find out which decks rose to the challenge!
