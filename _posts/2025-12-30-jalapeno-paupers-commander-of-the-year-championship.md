It’s the showdown we’ve been waiting for! The crew over at Jalapeno Paupers just dropped their "Commander of the Year Championship" match, bringing together the four most dominant decks from their 2025 season for one epic New Year’s Eve battle. If you want to see the pinnacle of Pauper Commander interaction, grab a seat, because this game delivers!

Miles, Bernie, Bryce, and Jacob all brought their A-game, piloting decks that truly showcase the diversity and power level of the PDH format. We have Miles running the aggressive White/Blue hero **Syr Vondam, the Lucent**, facing off against Bernie's resilient creature-based engine, **Sun-Spider Nimble Webber**. Challenging them are Bryce’s intricate control piece, **Black Waltz No. 3**, and Jacob's unique value engine, the **Cloudspire Coordinator**.

What makes this video so great isn't just the high-stakes gameplay—it’s the genuine fun and camaraderie these creators have while playing the format we all love. Watching these powerhouse decks, built entirely on common and uncommon cards, fight it out turn after turn is an incredible reminder of how deep and competitive Pauper Commander can be. Seriously, the game keeps escalating, with Turn 8 starting well after the thirty-minute mark!
