Hello, fellow Pauper Commanders! One of our favorite things about this community is the sheer creativity on display every single day. We love seeing brewers take an uncommon legend and build a beautiful, synergistic machine around it. That’s why we were so excited when the fantastic creator Jalapeno Paupers sent over their latest video deck tech. This one is a real treat—a spicy, grindy, and incredibly resilient list helmed by the one and only **Neva, Stalked by Nightmares**!

For those unfamiliar with this Orzhov all-star from *March of the Machine*, Neva is a value engine that just refuses to quit. Whenever she enters the battlefield or attacks, you get to return a creature *or* enchantment card from your graveyard to your hand. This simple, repeatable effect opens up a world of possibilities, allowing you to build a deck that can outlast almost any opponent by turning your graveyard into a second hand.

The core of the Jalapeno Paupers brew is a classic aristocrats strategy with a nightmarish, enchanting twist. You’re looking to flood the board with disposable creatures like Doomed Traveler and Carrier Thrall, who graciously leave behind friends when they die. You then sacrifice them to powerhouse outlets like Carrion Feeder and Viscera Seer to grow your threats and sculpt your draws. This is where Neva truly shines. Every attack trigger lets you bring back the creature you just sacrificed, ready to do it all over again.

But the real spice is in Neva’s ability to recur enchantments. The deck is packed with value-generating auras and enchantments that become a recurring nightmare for your opponents. Need removal? Bring back a Dead Weight or Mire's Grasp every turn to slowly pick apart their board. Want to protect your commander or another key creature? Loop Unholy Indenture to ensure they never stay dead for long. Enchantments like Omen of the Dead become repeatable Raise Dead effects, giving you unparalleled access to your best threats. The deck becomes a puzzle box of value, where every piece can be reused and repurposed thanks to your commander.

This isn't a deck that wins with a single, explosive turn. It’s a machine built for the long game. You’ll spend the early turns setting up your engine and the mid-to-late game grinding your opponents into dust under a mountain of card advantage. The satisfaction of sacrificing a creature, triggering a death effect, and then immediately getting it back with Neva’s attack is what Pauper Commander is all about!

This brew from Jalapeno Paupers is a masterclass in building a resilient and synergistic deck that feels incredibly powerful without breaking the bank. We highly encourage you to check out their full video for a card-by-card breakdown and gameplay footage.
